            <h3>Where the treaty was negotiated</h3>
            <p>Treaty 2 was negotiated in August 21 1871 at Manitoba House, which is also known as Manitoba Post Treaty.
            The Manitoba house is located in Kinosota, Manitoba.In the Canadians views, Treaty makings was a way
            to help people move to the west, and get Indeginous people to live more like European settlers. 
            Indeginous people fought to protect their land and culture while trying to juggle transitioning into 
            europeans new way of life. Treaties 1 and 2 tried to include other objectives leaving behind a lot of other issues.
            In 1871 the Indeginous in Portage La Prarie came to a conclusion that they have not recived anything for <span>their land or woods</span>
            and <span>their resources</span> were instead used to better the lives of the settlers. The Indeginous peoples
            attempted to fend off the settlers.

                <h3>The terms and conditions of treaty 2</h3>
                <p>
                    A major focus for First Nations during the treaty talks was securing enough land. Initially, 
                    they asked for reserves that would cover two-thirds of Manitoba’s area, but they were only 
                    granted 160 acres per family of five. Some chiefs argued that this wasn’t enough land, and they 
                    also complained that the yearly payment of $12 per family of five was too low.In the end several
                    Indigenous communities in Canada benefited from Treaty No. 2, which gives each family of five 160 acres of 
                    land, with extra land if the family is bigger or smaller. The treaty also promises a school on
                    each reserve and gives each family of five $15, with different amounts depending on family size.
                    It also sets aside special areas of land just for First Nations people to live on.</p>

                <h3>How the treaty is being implemented today</h3>
                <p>The numbered treaties spread awareness of awareness and rights of the Indegenious people. 
                    The treaty set up reserves for the Chippewa and Cree peoples. While Treaty 2 does not provide for explicit 
                    self-government, the AMC (Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs) and MKO (Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak) have developed
                    their own governance structures and institutions.The treaty’s rules about education and healthcare are being put into
                    action through teamwork between Indigenous groups, the government, and healthcare providers. There is also a school that has to
                    be put up in every reserve.
